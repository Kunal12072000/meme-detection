# Meme-detection
This repo building an ml model to detect meme from rest of the images
## Run command
In order to run navigate to meme-detection folder
``` python3 main.py```
## Evaluation metrics
1-> test accuracy will be shown in terminal 
2-> learning curve will be saved to learning_curves.png
3-> layer of the CNN and parameters info will be also available in terminal

##Result
-> Attained a accuracy of 99.88% accuracy on test data with train accuracy as 99.98%
-> in result folder have learning curve of my training process(learning_curves.png)
-> learning_curve_with_more_feature has learning when we try to increase feature in layers
